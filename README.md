# VRoid
3d character modeling software used for creation of character models used in Vtubing, vr chat, animations and 3d printing. 

**Team members:**
- Ketrin
- Raielo
- Kallas

**Basic plan:**

- Create a 3d character model using the software 

- Use VSeeFace to use for vtubing 

- Play Vrchat for 12 hours to get the new user to be able to upload character models 

- Needs to be optimized in unity to be imported into vrchat 

- Animations for walk, run, crouch etc.

- Just 3d print it I guess 

## Getting started with VRoid:
VRoid Studio is an application for making (mostly anime-style) virtual avatars. Avatars are saved as **.vmd** files that can be used with programs such as VRChat, Unity3D, Blender, MikuMikuDance, and various VMD and VTuber software.

You create an avatar using the built-in body and clothing models, all of which have parametric options and can be retextured by importing texture files and by drawing on the model or texture view in-app. Each model contains a stack of textures that are overlaid to create a composed texture for the model. For example, an underwear texture may be overlaid over a tattoo texture, which is then overlaid over a base skin texture.

Avatars may be shared, downloaded, and used with VMD apps on the VRoid Hub site.

It is also possible to have an avatar commissioned by an artist.

You can do post-processing on the model in Blender (or Unity if your usage is for VR Chat).
