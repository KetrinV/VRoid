# VRoid
3d character modeling software used for creation of character models used in Vtubing, vr chat, animations and 3d printing. 

**Basic plan:**

Create a 3d character model using the software 

Use VSeeFace to use for vtubing 

Play Vrchat for 12 hours to get the new user to be able to upload character models 

Needs to be optimized in unity to be imported into vrchat 

No animation plans atm 

Just 3d print it I guess
